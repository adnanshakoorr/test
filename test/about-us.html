                            <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
                            <p>My name is Matthew and I want to tell you a bit about my journey.</p>
                            <p>I’ve always known that I wanted to do something special with my life, and I’ve always wanted to connect with people and help them feel strong and empowered. But the truth is, I struggled a lot growing up.</p>
                            <p>
                                Like a lot of children my age, I was bullied physically and emotionally for my looks, my personality, and my values. I never seemed to fit in or connect to people in a way that made sense or felt authentic.
                            </p>
                            <p>Having gone through that as kid, I still faced similar issues as an adult. I was always looking for ways to fit in. I looked for heroes in my life who would save me. I looked to friends, romantic relationships, therapists, mentors and gurus. I tried everything I could to find the secret to being happy, but I often felt like I was spinning my wheels. I spent so much of my life depressed and anxious, never truly living a satisfying life that I wanted.</p>
                            <!--<p>Hi! I’m Matthew and I want to tell you a little bit about myself. Like everyone else, I too wanted to be somebody special. I wanted to help people out and make them feel strong, confident and in charge of their lives. But I couldn’t accomplish that as I faced a lot of physical, emotional and psychological turmoil when I was a boy. Some of those issues are still with me and I find myself fighting hard to keep them at bay.-->
                            <!--</p>-->

                            <!--<p>When I was growing up, I was physically and verbally bullied for the way I look, the values that I had, and my personality. I was the local weirdo and my reputation stayed with me for a long time. It kept me from making authentic connections and creating a network. After going through all that pain and suffering through disappointment and depression, I realized the pain and suffering that others must feel too. I could relate to their insecurities and lack of confidence in a major way. This realization made me be strong and fight for the people who are defenseless and fragile.</p>-->

                            <!-- <p>Another thing that greatly helped me on my way was my love for super heroes. During my younger days, these super heroes were all that kept me sane and on the right side. I developed a huge bond with them through comics and in movies and television. That is when I realized that super heroes don’t have to be on a page or inside a screen only. And the idea of this website came to me. I decided that I would help people find out their inner super hero and help them channelize it to live a fulfilling and enriched life.</p>

          <p>I know that you can do it and I have faith in you. Welcome to the first step of your super hero journey</p>

          <p>I’m Matthew and I’m here for you. </p>

                        <div class="col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
                            <img src="images/about-pic.png" class="img-responsive" />
                        </div>

                        <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
                            <div class="top-text">
                                <p>
                                    After many painful years I eventually realized that I couldn’t rely on others to find that happiness or confidence. I had to take a deep look inside myself and start holding myself accountable. I wanted
                                    to commit to making a real change.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I would always feel overwhelmed by my larger goals, so I started developing small habits that seemed ineffective at the time. But those small changes created a foundation. I started slowly rebuilding
                                    myself, brick by brick, one day at a time. Physically, emotionally, and spiritually I began to change.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The truth is, change didn’t happen overnight. Becoming a hero to myself wasn’t always a grand and epic adventure. There were plenty of sacrifices I had to make along the way. I dedicated myself to change
                                    and eliminated distractions and relationships that were holding me down. I made a commitment to finding that hero.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Since then, I’ve felt a desire to help people who have felt their own sense of inadequacy. Whether through bullying, emotional or physical trauma, I have always felt a strong desire to lift up those who
                                    feel the same internal struggle that I did.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For the majority of my life I have also loved superheroes. Through my own journey, I quickly realized that if I could do this, others could too. But to do so, it would require time, dedication and action.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    My Heroic Life isn’t just a saying or a catchy phrase; it’s a call to action. It is an opportunity for each of us to live better, fulfilling and empowering lives. It is a choice that we make every single
                                    day to do the right thing. It’s an opportunity to lift ourselves and each other up and to stand strong in the face of adversity.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    My hope is that you will come here to find inspiration and take control of your life. A place that encourages you to find your inner passions, and to become the hero you were always meant to be. I hope
                                    that through my podcast, you will find that inspiration and discover that YOU alone have the responsibility to change your life, and that nobody else can give you that power.
                                </p>
                                <p>I have complete faith in you. And I am glad you are here. Let’s begin our heroic journey together. One step at a time.</p>
