<p>“The One You Feed podcast uses <a href="https://www.oneyoufeed.net/about-the-parable/" target="_blank" style="color: #5c9fc9;">the parable of two wolves at battle within us</a> as a jumping-off point for meaningful discussions about how to live skillfully amidst life’s inherent challenges.”</p>
<p>I highly recommend this podcast. There were so many times in my life where I was facing a difficulty and turned to one the episodes from The One You Feed. There are so many deep meaningful discussions on life and how we react to inner challenges.

<p>“The One You Feed podcast uses <a href="https://www.oneyoufeed.net/about-the-parable/" target="_blank" style="color: #5c9fc9;">the parable of two wolves at battle within us</a> as a jumping-off point for meaningful discussions about how to live skillfully amidst life’s inherent challenges.”</p>
<p>I highly recommend this podcast. There were so many times in my life where I was facing a difficulty and turned to one the episodes from The One You Feed. There are so many deep meaningful discussions on life and how we react to inner challenges.
